## Design Requirements

### Objectives
The objective of this project is to create test suits for a Howitzer Firing Simulator. The main objective is not to desing the simulator but to design tests in order to verify the kinematic and dynamic of the simulator.

### Constraints
- Economic Factors:
    - The project will consider the cost of the equipment, the cost of implmentation, operational costs and maintance costs.
    - The project will require analysis of the rate of return on the initial investement, and ways of cost reducation for 
      long term deployment.
- Regulatory Compliance (Security and Access):
    - The simulator should abide by the security standards and the protocols to protect sensitive information such as encruption of the data
      and access control measures.
    - The Access Control Measure should be implemented in a way that certain personale should have specific level of authorization to ensure
      only designated personale or trained soldiers can operate the simulator.
- Ethics:
    - The main ethical consideration when designing the simulator is not having any harmful or malicious intentions and it shoudld
      strictly follow the training rules when in use.
    - The data privacy should be handled in a secure manner to ensure it aligns with the regulatory data protection laws
- Societal Impacts:
    - The design of the stimulator should be usable by all groups of people, meaning that the design should be user friendly and 
      should be accessible to all. The main considerations would be interface and accomodating individuals with disabilities.
    - Impact should also be taken into consideration. The stimulator should stimulate a positive environment and should not be 
      taken in a negative manner.
